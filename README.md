## Abstract
Coming soon.

## Replicability
UMAP works with random initialization, which in turn can depend on your operating system and the package versions that you are using. Furthermore, embedding models can be updated and change over time. That said, if you compute your own sentence and/or UMAP embeddings, your results might look slightly different. For full replicability, please work with the provided embeddings and materials. The environment that we used for our analyses can be reproduced using the .yml file included in this repository (coming soon).
